# web-calculator
a simple web-calculator

## What is this project about?
I wanted to make a small app and prove myself I learned enough to make one.
It can be clicked and can be used by keyboard:
+ numbers 0-9 => self-explanatory
+ +,-,(x,*),/ -> operators
+ ESC, backspace -> AC, Del respectively
+ G -> another tab to my github profile.

## What took the longest?
Identifying the steps and actually considering to:

+ write down the states of 
+ the steps done to change the variables
+ the state of the variables after
considering the steps yet again to make sure it works.

Afterwards it was **easier** to fill out the colorful behaviour because I actually logged each step in the code.
You can see them when you use the console while using the calculator.

If anyone has an idea on how to get quicker to the beef of the issue that takes so much time, I would be thankful.
